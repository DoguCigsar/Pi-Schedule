## Code Structure

Files and folders outside of "src" folder is mostly default boilerplate code, files inside the "src" folder are the actual files required for the website to run.

Inside the src folder there are two folders "lib" contains modules that can be imported from anywhere and "routes" contains folders and files that are about the actual pages of the website.

Inside the "routes" folder (and folders within) there are files for the page structure/style and basic scripts (+page.svelte), and there are actual script files (+page.js/+page.ts JavaScript and TypeScript).
